# em-ray-tracing
An electromagnetic ray-tracing engine for research purpose

Are you a beginner in computer graphics, spatical subdivision algorithms, or electromagnetic theories?
Are you looking for a demo program that does em-simulation with the geometric-optics algorithm?

If so, this project is good start point for you. You have to deal with the "multi-ray" problem yourself
if you wish to get accurate simulation results. If you don't know what is "multi-ray", you have to do some reseach on Google Scholar.

*This project is not maintained*, but forking is welcome.
